# Scheduler

Scheduler is an application which helps in scheduling tasks for you so that you don't have to
remember them. Scheduler creates un-dismissible notification which you can remove by pressing a
dismiss button. The app also allows you to postpone the task by up to 5 days

## Why

An issue with keeping reminders is you have to go into the apps or maybe a notepad to check what
tasks are scheduled for today. This increases the chances of you forgetting the existence of such a
list of task. With this app, you can schedule a task for a specific day and the app would create an
un-dismissible which the user can dismiss if the tasks gets completed or can have it postponed if he
wants to. This means that the notification would be present till either the user dismisses it or
postpones it for another day.

## Releases
